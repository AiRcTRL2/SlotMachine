Though I do assign their index to 3 separate variables later, this was easier during the testing phase. I recognise it probably makes more sense to set each Column() object up separately as c1, c2 and c3 and access their values using each object. It would have saved the need for assigning the index to variables x,y,z in the score_slot() method, or index checking in the show_slot() method..
